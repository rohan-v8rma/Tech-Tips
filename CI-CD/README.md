# Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment

# What are the learning pre-requisites before setting up your own CI/CD pipeline?

Before setting up your own CI/CD pipeline, it's important to have a good understanding of the following concepts and technologies:

## Version Control 

Understanding the basic concepts of version control, such as commits, branches, and merging, is essential for setting up a CI/CD pipeline. Familiarity with Git and Github is recommended.

## Build Tools 

Build tools such as Webpack, Grunt or Gulp are used to automate the building process of the code. Understanding how to use these tools and configure them to work with your codebase is important.

## Continuous Integration 

Understanding the basic concepts of continuous integration (CI) such as automated testing, building, and deployment is important for setting up a CI/CD pipeline. Familiarity with tools such as Jenkins, TravisCI or CircleCI is recommended.

## Containerization 

Understanding the concepts of containerization and how to use tools such as Docker is important for setting up a CI/CD pipeline. Containers are used to package and deploy code in a consistent environment.

## Cloud Services 

Understanding the basic concepts of cloud services and how to use them is important for setting up a CI/CD pipeline. Familiarity with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure is recommended.

## Scripting 

Good understanding of scripting languages such as Bash or Python is important for setting up a CI/CD pipeline. Scripting is used to automate tasks and integrate different tools in the pipeline.

## Deployment 

Understanding the basics of deployment and the different strategies, such as blue-green deployment and rolling deployment, is important for setting up a CI/CD
